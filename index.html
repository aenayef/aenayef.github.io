        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I am a brain-body research and development engineer with more than a decade experience specializing in the processing, mining, and leveraging of human physiological signals. From mining brainwaves to assess attention and other cognitive functions; quantifying surface muscular electrical signal for improving human robot interaction; extracting and separating fetal heart rate from mother's ECG non-invasively for better monitoring; A  unifying theme emerges, covering multiple modalities, to detect 1) physical, 2) emotional / affective, 3) cognitive / neural, or 4) social state, and then attempt to reinforce or alter such state for better results. 
         <br>
        My research has revolved around understanding and modulating oscillatory dynamics that drives such human behaviors: physical, emotional, cognitive, and social. Such processes, if successfully deciphered and applied, can touch the quality of life in every aspect from the way we move - interact, feel - express emotions, think - focus, and connect. 
         <br>
    ​    My mission is to research and develop tools, technologies, and algorithms to empower people to take charge of their destiny by enabling them to reprogram their mind and body so they can eliminate undesired habits, rewire brain circuits or acquire new skills efficiently whenever they please and reach their potential.  </p>
